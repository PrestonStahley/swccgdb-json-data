## JSON text editing tips

Full description of (very simple) JSON format can be found [here](http://www.json.org/), below there are a few tips most relevant to editing this repository.

#### Non-ASCII symbols

When symbols outside the regular [ASCII range](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#ASCII_printable_code_chart) are needed, UTF-8 symbols come in play. These need to be escaped using `\u<4 letter hexcode>`.

To get the 4-letter hexcode of a UTF-8 symbol (or look up what a particular hexcode represents), you can use a UTF-8 converter, such as [this online tool](http://www.ltg.ed.ac.uk/~richard/utf-8.cgi).

#### Quotes and breaking text into multiple lines

To have quotes as part of the text, use `\"`.  For example, `"flavor": "\"If you only knew the power of the dark side.\""` results in following flavor text:

> *"If you only knew the power of the dark side."*

#### SW:CCG symbols

These can be used in a card's `text` section.

 * `[unique]`
 * `[restricted]`
 * `[maintain]`
 * `[recycle]`
 * `[sacrifice]`
